# WebSocket Checkbox Synchronizer

Inspired by [One Million Checkboxes](https://onemillioncheckboxes.com/). It's a simple WebSocket application that allows multiple clients to connect and synchronize checkbox states in real-time. <br>

This project is for educational and entertainment purposes only. The implementation was mostly done using AI tools and is far from best practice. Some of the implementation is quite hacky, but good enough for a basic showcase.
